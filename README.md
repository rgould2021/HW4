# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici!*

Submitted by: **Ricky Gould**

This web app: **Random dog photos pop up filling the breed, weight, age attributes. Can ban certain attributes so it prevents the API from fetching something with that attribute in the future.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!
      Better CSS styling and make it generally look better but I got all the functions needed done.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
API calls are tough, it is hard to get the exact data you need and display it how you need it to.
